{"title":"Gin Gimlet","ingredients":["While one could make a gimlet with vodka, we must urge you to try this '30s-era cocktail with gin, as it brings herbaceous flavor to this simple, two-ingredient drink.","Gimlet","THIS CLASSIC COCKTAIL WAS ORIGINALLY CONCEIVED by the British navy as a remedy for avoiding scurvy, combining their rations of gin and lime juice. The name was inspired by a gimlet, the corkscrew-like device used to tap into the lime juice kegs. A key ingredient in the Gimlet is Roses lime juice (otherwise known as lime cordial), introduced by Lauchlin Rose of Scotland as yet another preventative for scurvy in 1867. In The Long Goodbye, writer Raymond Chandler glamorized the drink for the masses when his character, detective Philip Marlowe, pontificated on his favorite cocktail: A real gimlet is half gin and half Roses lime juice and nothing else. The classic recipe from the 1930s Savoy Hotel bar is indeed made of equal parts Plymouth gin and Roses lime juice. Of course, there are many variations according to personal preference, from different ratios of gin to lime juice to the addition of water or club soda, and, for those who desire fresh lime juice instead of Roses, a teaspoon of sugar or  teaspoon simple syrup is needed. Many also enjoy a sugar rim, first moistened with lime juice.","Classic Gimlet","Image","2ounces gin","1 ounces Roses lime juice","Lime wedge"],"directions":["Stir the gin and lime juice in a mixing glass with ice.

{"title":"Mint Julep","ingredients":["A KENTUCKY TRADITION THAT HAS BEEN AROUND since the late 1800s, the refreshing and quintessentially Southern frosted julep is traditionally enjoyed as a celebratory libation to usher in the spring on May Day and, more importantly, is the official signature drink at the Kentucky Derby on the first Saturday in May. Traced back to the 15th century, Juleps were originally medicinal concoctions blending herbs, sugar, and water. They later evolved into drinks combining mint with brandy, peach brandy, or Cognac, until around 1875, when fine Kentucky bourbon became the spirit of choice.","Traditionally, the mint\u2019s only function was as an aromatic flourish at the edge of the drink, but inevitably, as variations ensued, controversy arose over the correct methodology, which Southerners still debate today. Some say that the key is in the placement of the mint, which should be extended above the rim to allow one to inhale the aroma while sipping the bourbon. Some, however, prefer to muddle the mint first to infuse the bourbon with its aromatic fragrance. Extreme mint aficionados will go so far as to infuse a bottle of bourbon with a few cups of mint leaves, a method that is quite efficient when one is hosting a crowd, as it can be refrigerated for up to a week.","In keeping with tradition, the julep is classically served in a silver julep cup, the perfect vessel to achieve that signature frost as the bourbon and crushed ice are stirred until the condensation turns icy. It is perfectly suitable to serve a julep in either a collins, highball, or old-fashioned glass, although the type of glassware is less important than the type of bourbon used\u2014a premium bourbon such as Maker\u2019s Mark, Knob Creek, or Woodford Reserve is essential to a sublime julep.","Traditional Southern-Style Mint Julep","4 ounces Kentucky bourbon","1 teaspoon simple syrup","4 to 6 mint sprigs"],"directions":["Muddle mint, sugar and water in Highball Glass.","Fill glass with cracked ice, add Bourbon and stir well until the glass is frost.","Garnish with a mint spring."],"misc":["The Mint Julep was made famous by Robert Duvall in Thank You For Smoking","Suggested glassware is Silver Julep Cup"],"source":"The Ultimate Bar Book","ner":["bourbon"]}

{"title":"Sazerac","ingredients":["THIS NEW ORLEANS CLASSIC IS AS CHARMING as a soft Southern drawl. As cocktail legend has it, it was the first drink to be concocted and specifically called a cocktail. Around the 1830s, a Frenchman named Peychaud was behind the counter of his Pharmacie in New Orleans, serving up this elixir in a cocquetier, or egg cup. When mis- pronounced, according to the tale, cocquetier resulted in the term \u201ccocktail.\u201d He came up with this drink, originally made with Cognac and his Peychaud\u2019s bitters, as a vehicle for his soothing digestive creation. By the 1850s, the cocktail had become enormously popular, and it had been given the name \u201cSazerac\u201d after an imported French Cognac, Sazerac de Forge et Fils, that was used to make it. By 1870, the ingredients had changed, as drinking establishments opted for the cheaper American rye whiskey to replace Cognac and absinthe was introduced into the equation. Once absinthe became illegal, Pernod replaced it.","Traditionally made with good-quality Cognac, or its replacement of rye whiskey (such as Old Overholt), the Sazerac is now often preferred with a great bourbon such as Knob Creek or Maker\u2019s Mark. In New Orleans, Herbsaint, a local anise-flavored liqueur, is favored over Pernod.","Later recipes have added a sugar cube and water, but the following is the original method. The glass must be thoroughly chilled, and although Sazerac purists will tell you not to drop the lemon twist in the drink, a subtle spritz of lemon oil is quite a pleasant addition. Drop it in if you prefer.","Classic Sazerac","1 teaspoon Pernod (or Herbsaint)","2 ounces Cognac (or bourbon or rye)","3 to 4 dashes Peychaud\u2019s bitters","Lemon twist","","The World\u2019s Drinks and How to Mix Them:","\u2022 1 Small Barspoonful Gum Syrup ","\u2022 3 Drops Selner Bitters ","\u2022 1 Jigger Sazerac Brandy","rince a glass with absinthe","stir on ice and strain into cocktail-glass","***Squeeze Lemon peel over the top and serve with ice Water on the side***"],"directions":[],"misc":["The Sazerac was made famous by Roger Moore in Live and Let Die"],"source":"The Ultimate Bar Book","ner":["brandy","whiskey","pernod","cognac","absinthe","bourbon"]}
